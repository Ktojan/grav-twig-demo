    <h2>Applying Filters in Smart Folders</h2>
    <p>By default, Clean Email shows you all messages in your mailbox, regardless of the messages labels or folders.
      
  {% include 'partials/banner-special-price.html.twig' with { 'wrap': 'wrap-right' } %}
        
  Therefore, you can see both starred and unstarred messages from any folder or label in your account. <br>
  <i>Before</i> you take any action on a group of messages, use the <b>Filters</b> button in the Smart Folder to exclude
  the messages you want to keep. That way, the only messages displayed will be ones that you actually want to remove or
  delete.
  </p>
    <p>The Auto Clean feature lets you create rules that automatically clean incoming email messages before they ever reach your inbox.
        This includes functions such as automatically archiving, trashing, or deleting unwanted messages; adding or removing stars or flags;
        or delivering the messages to a different folder or label other than your inbox. </p>
    
      {% include 'partials/banner-special-price.html.twig' with { 'wrap': '' } %}
      <p>You can click the <b>Filters</b> button more than once to apply more than one filter at the same time. In the
      illustration above, the <b>Without star</b> filter is already applied, and the <b>Not Labeled</b> filter is being
      added; since both filters are applied, neither messages with the selected label(s) nor any message with a star
      will be included in the view. </p>

    <h2>Applying Filters when Creating an Auto Clean Rule</h2>
    <p>Since Auto Clean works primarily on future incoming messages, by default it would not affect starred or flagged
      messages, nor messages in a specific folder or label. 
        
        {% include 'partials/banner-special-price.html.twig' with { 'wrap': 'wrap-left' } %}
        
      However, when you create an Auto Clean rule, you have the
      option to apply the rule to existing messages that match the ruleâ€™s criteria. </p>

    <p>It is important to use caution when creating an Auto Clean rule, to ensure that the rule only applies to messages
      you want to affect. If you plan to enable the toggle to apply the new rule to existing messages, there are a
      couple of precautions to be aware of. </p>
