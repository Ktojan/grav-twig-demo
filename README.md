# grav-twig-demo
This is a minimal set of files. Inside grav-admin structure they are:
- grav-admin/system/templates/partials/banner-special-price.html.twig
- grav-admin/user/pages/banner-special-price.css (just for demo)
- grav-home.html is just a code of Admin page that uses 'banner-special-price' template

With the usage of input { 'wrap': 'wrap-right' } that defines variable class inside Twig template, we can easily define wrap style of banner (left, right, centered or no-wrap). All four are present on the page

 ## This is 2 parts of one page
